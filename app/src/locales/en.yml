  overview: |-
    This game is online match version of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/rooms/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wordle</a>.<br />
    (Not an official Wordle game.)<br />
    <br />
    Each player is assigned their own secret word and repeat the guessing alternately to hit the opponent's word.<br />
    <b>Judgments on player guesses are made on each player's words, including themselves.</b><br />
    Let's search for the information of the opponent's word without exposing the information of your own word as much as possible.
